", "2:16  Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:  ", "2:17  Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.  ", "2:18  Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,  ", "2:19  And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.

", "2:23  Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.  ", "3:1  If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.  ", "3:2  Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.  ", "3:3  For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.  ", "3:4  When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.  ", "3:5  Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:  ", "3:6  For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:  ", "3:7  In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.  ", "3:8  But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.  ", "3:9  Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;  ", "3:10  And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:  ", "3:11  Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.  ", "3:12  Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;  ", "3:13  Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.  ", "3:14  And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.  ", "3:15  And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.  ", "3:16  Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

", "3:20  Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.  ", "3:21  Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.  ", "3:22  Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;  ", "3:23  And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;  ", "3:24  Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.  ", "3:25  But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.  ", "4:1  Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.  ", "4:2  Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;  ", "4:3  Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:  ", "4:4  That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.  ", "4:5  Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.  ", "4:6  Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.  ", "4:7  All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:  ", "4:8  Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;  ", "4:9  With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here.  ", "4:10  Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)  ", "4:11  And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.  ", "4:12  Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.  ", "4:13  For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.  ", "4:14  Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.  ", "4:15  Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.  ", "4:16  And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.  ", "4:17  And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.  ", "4:18  The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.  "];
