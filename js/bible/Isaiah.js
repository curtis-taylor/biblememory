", "8:9 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.  ", "8:10 Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.  ", "8:11 For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, ", "8:12 Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.  ", "8:13 Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.  ", "8:14 And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
