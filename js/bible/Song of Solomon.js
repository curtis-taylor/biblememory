", "6:5 Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.  ", "6:6 Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.  ", "6:7 As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.  ", "6:8 There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.  ", "6:9 My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.  ", "6:10 Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?  ", "6:11 I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded.  ", "6:12 Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.  ", "6:13 Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.  ", "7:1 How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.  ", "7:2 Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.  ", "7:3 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.  ", "7:4 Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.  ", "7:5 Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.  ", "7:6 How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!  ", "7:7 This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.  ", "7:8 I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples; ", "7:9 And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.  ", "7:10 I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.  ", "7:11 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.  ", "7:12 Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.  ", "7:13 The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.  ", "8:1 O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother!  when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.  ", "8:2 I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.  ", "8:3 His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.  ", "8:4 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.  ", "8:5 Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.  ", "8:6 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.  ", "8:7 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.  ", "8:8 We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?  ", "8:9 If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.  ", "8:10 I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.  ", "8:11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.  ", "8:12 My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.  ", "8:13 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it.  ", "8:14 Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.  "];
