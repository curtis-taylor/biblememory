", "6:20 My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: ", "6:21 Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.  ", "6:22 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.  ", "6:23 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: ", "6:24 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.  ", "6:25 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.

", "7:2 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.  ", "7:3 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.  ", "7:4 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman: ", "7:5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.  ", "7:6 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, ", "7:7 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, ", "7:8 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house, ", "7:9 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: ", "7:10 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.  ", "7:11 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: ", "7:12 Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)  ", "7:13 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him, ", "7:14 I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.  ", "7:15 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.  ", "7:16 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.  ", "7:17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.  ", "7:18 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.  ", "7:19 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: ", "7:20 He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.  ", "7:21 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.  ", "7:22 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; ", "7:23 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.  ", "7:24 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.  ", "7:25 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.  ", "7:26 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.  ", "7:27 Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.  ", "8:1 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?  ", "8:2 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.  ", "8:3 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.  ", "8:4 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.  ", "8:5 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.  ", "8:6 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.  ", "8:7 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.  ", "8:8 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.  ", "8:9 They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.  ", "8:10 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.  ", "8:11 For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.  ", "8:12 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.  ", "8:13 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.  ", "8:14 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.  ", "8:15 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.  ", "8:16 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.  ", "8:17 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.

", "8:20 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: ", "8:21 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.  ", "8:22 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.  ", "8:23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.  ", "8:24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.

", "9:12 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.  ", "9:13 A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.  ", "9:14 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city, ", "9:15 To call passengers who go right on their ways: ", "9:16 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, ", "9:17 Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
