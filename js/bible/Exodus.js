And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.  ", "4:19 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.  ", "4:20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.

", "5:5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.  ", "5:6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, ", "5:7 Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.  ", "5:8 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.  ", "5:9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.  ", "5:10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.  ", "5:11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.  ", "5:12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.  ", "5:13 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.  ", "5:14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?  ", "5:15 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?  ", "5:16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.  ", "5:17 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.  ", "5:18 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.  ", "5:19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.  ", "5:20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: ", "5:21 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.  ", "5:22 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?  ", "5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.  ", "6:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.  ", "6:2 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD: ", "6:3 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.  ", "6:4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.

", "6:6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: ", "6:7 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.  ", "6:8 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.

", "40:28 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.  ", "40:29 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.
