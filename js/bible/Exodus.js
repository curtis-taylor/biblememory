", "5:16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.  ", "5:17 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.  ", "5:18 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.  ", "5:19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.  ", "5:20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: ", "5:21 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.  ", "5:22 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?  ", "5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.  ", "6:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.

", "16:20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.

", "40:26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail: ", "40:27 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.  ", "40:28 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.  ", "40:29 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.  ", "40:30 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.  ", "40:31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat: ", "40:32 When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.  ", "40:33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.  ", "40:34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.  ", "40:35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.  ", "40:36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys: ", "40:37 But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.  ", "40:38 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.  "];
